Some upgrades to add soon:
-- Generate a downloadable pdf that adds all data (Inputs, Calculated outputs and the approximated dimensions)

-- Make a download link..

I keep running into a LocalBoundVariable error, not figured out why yet.
Incase you run into it, go to views.py, locate a variable Tt in the context, add a tab before it then delete the tab.
That should temporarily fix the error in the meantime while I work on a better solution.
If you have a fix idea please feel free to make a pull request.
