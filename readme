# Project Title
Rocketry Nozzle Dimensions Calculation Report Generator

## Overview
This project is a portfolio project aimed at learning and showcasing my skills in web development using Django and data visualization with Matplotlib. The purpose of the project is to create a web application that allows users to input data, perform calculations, and generate downloadable PDF reports based on the input. The project serves as a platform for me to demonstrate my proficiency in building interactive web applications and integrating data visualization capabilities. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to explore the use of Django for back-end development and Matplotlib for generating dynamic charts and graphs.
